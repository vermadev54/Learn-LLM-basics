# Learn-LLM-basics

This repository is dedicated to learning how to build Large Language Models (LLMs) from scratch using Jupyter Notebooks. The purpose is to provide a comprehensive guide and resources for understanding the fundamentals and practical implementation of LLMs.

## Repository Structure

- **Notebooks**: Contains Jupyter Notebooks with step-by-step tutorials and code examples.
  - `Building_BERT/building_BERT_from_scrach.ipynb`: Notebook to build BERT from scratch.
  - `Building_BERT/finetuning_BERT_Regression.ipynb`: Notebook to fine-tune BERT for regression tasks.
  - `Building_BERT/finetuning_bert_classification.ipynb`: Notebook to fine-tune BERT for classification tasks.
- **Data**: Sample datasets used in the tutorials.
- **Models**: Pre-trained models and scripts for training new models.
